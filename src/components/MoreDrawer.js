              <h5>Hey! Thank you for clicking "more." I appreciate it. <br /> <br /> 
              Can I be real? I'm a new software engineer (obviously). I'm a career shifter. <br />
              I was successful in my entertainment career, but finding and keeping jobs in that field is like a lottery. <br /><br />
              My technical skills are growing rapidly as I navigate my post-bootcamp life. I'm a trainable, fast learning, dedicated guy. <br />
              I value and prioritize creative, outgoing and kind human interaction. I seek out and appreciate the human element in workplaces. <br /><br />
              Through no conscious effort, I naturally fell into a role on campus as someone with whom my classmates could have a sincere, encouraging conversation.<br /><br />
              When our bootcam's cost-saving, corner cutting tactics felt like a total rug-pull on the student body, I mobilized my cohort so we could collectively demand (and successfully receive) better learning conditions. <br /><br />
              I present, communicate and connect in a way that will make an impression. <br />
              Thank you for reading.
                <br /><br />
